I am Sandipan Haldar. I completed my undergraduates degree from IIT Guwahati. Currently I am working as a Data Scientist. Since my college I have been interested in intersection of robotics and reinforcement learning. This blog is primarily about documenting some of my current and previous works and some of the knowledge I gained while in the field of AI.
